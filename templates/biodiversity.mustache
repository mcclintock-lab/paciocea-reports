        Some species of deep sea coral can build real reefs and consequently, constitute habitats for a large range of deep species. These species are extremely vulnerable for threat from deep fisheries or deep sea mining. Davis and Guinotte (2011) performed a modeling approach for 2 habitat building coral species: <i>Enallopsammia rostrata</i> and <i>Solenosmilia variabilis</i>.

        An Endangered (EN) species is a species which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as likely to become extinct. "Endangered" is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after Critically Endangered (CR). Turtles are among the world's most endangered vertebrates, with about half of all turtle species threatened with extinction. One third of open ocean sharks are threatened with extinction. Scientists estimate that 26 - 73 million sharks are killed each year for the global fin trade. 

        Maps show the colour-coded relative likelihood of a species to occur in a global grid of half-degree latitude / longitude cell dimensions, which corresponds to a side length of about 50 km near the equator. Predictions are generated by matching habitat usage of species, termed environmental envelopes, against local environmental conditions to determine the relative suitability of specific geographic areas for a given species. Knowledge of species' distributions within FAO areas or bounding boxes is also used to exclude potentially suitable habitat in which the species is not known to occur.

        Functional sensitivity of reef fish community is defined as the proportion of functional entities that show no redundancy (represented by a very few number of species or by endangered species). Within a reef fish species assemblage, functional entities are groups of species defined by a combination of common characteristics (size, mobility, trophic category…). Presence of all functional entities is essential for the good functioning of the whole ecosystem. The loss of one functional entity may perturb the functioning of the whole assemblage (including outstanding species). Functional sensitivity is defined as the proportion of functional entities in an assemblage that show no redundancy (represented by a very few number of species or by endangered species). Results show a really high sensitivity all over the word. Even in the high species richness zones like Indonesia or Papua-New Guinea, more than one third of the functional entities are represented by single species. Periphery of Pacific Islands Region, starting from Samoa to the east, shows a really high sensitivity with more than one half of functional entities considered as sensitive.

        Hydrothermal vents host communities that not rely on photosynthesis for primary production. Both systems are largely driven by chemosynthetic derived energy. They are generally located along spreading ridges and are considered as “oasis of biodiversity” in deep environment. They may represent hotspot of biodiversity, especially for the shallower ones. Theses ecosystems are extremely sensitive due to the high level of endemics species and their slow recovery potential.
